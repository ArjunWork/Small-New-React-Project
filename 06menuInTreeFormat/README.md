Project :
<b># Expandable Menu with Recursive Rendering</b>
<br>

This project demonstrates a React component that creates an expandable and collapsible multi-level menu with nested items. It showcases:
<br>
State management for menu visibility: Uses React's useState hook to track which child menus are expanded or collapsed.
<br>
Recursive rendering: Renders nested menu items recursively, allowing for any level of depth.
<br>
Conditional rendering: Controls the visibility of child menus and icons based on state.
<br><br>

Features:
<br>
Expands and collapses child menus with toggle icons.
<br>
Handles any number of nested menu levels.
<br>
Uses clear and concise component structure.
<br><br>

Technologies Used:
<br>
